Ordinary - Alex Warren

VERSE 1
They say the holy waters watered down and this town's lost its faith
Our colors will fade Eventually
So if our time is running out day after day we’ll make the mundane our masterpiece

PRE
Oh my my Oh my my
Love I take one look at you

CHORUS
Taking me out of
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine the
Angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got
me kissing the ground of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust the
Angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

VERSE 2
Hopeless hallelujah
Oh this side of heaven’s gates
On my life
How do ya Breathe and Take my breath away
At your alter I will pray
You’re the sculptor I’m the clay
Oh my my

CHORUS
You’re taking me out
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got me kissing the ground
of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found

BRIDGE
Something so heavenly
Higher than ecstasy whenever your next to me
Oh my my world was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find something so out

CHORUS
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got me kissing the ground
of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust
The Angels up in the clouds Are jealous knowing we found
